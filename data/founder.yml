    message     : In the capacity of a Managing Director of an Industrial Welfare Service Provider, what I got asked frequently was "Why Industrial Catering?" and  "What makes GICPL's Service special?" Clients, Staff, Donors -- they all wanted to know. 40 years back when I was a young man and began working in this industry it was grossly overpassed and unregulated. I was among the few pioneers in this industry that worked in some very challenging and harsh environments. My forte lied in striking that balance between Welfare and Productivity. Besides the key to GICPL's success and long-standing lies in the three aspects of its distinctive service history:- its food, its love to serve, and its commitment to make it the best meal. With this passion, expertise & commitment to consistency at what we do best we serve Corporate, Industrial, Institutional, and the Health Care Industry all over Gujarat and hope to be at your service very soon in the near future.
