    desg        : Founders Note
    message1     : As the Managing Director of an Industrial Welfare Service Provider, I was frequently asked by our clients, staff and donors 'Why industrial catering?' and 'What makes GICPL's service special?'.
    message2     : Forty years ago, as a young man, I found myself working in an industry that was generally unrecognised and unorganised. 
    message3     : I was among the few early pioneers who saw the opportunities in this industry and strived to realise these by adopting a more systematic and professional approach in a challenging and testing environment. 
    message4     : My forte was in striking the crucial balance between delivering a customer focused service of outstanding quality and encompassing the concept of welfare as an overarching ethos. 
    message5     : The key to GICPL's long standing success lies in the three pillars of its distinctive service:- its love to serve, its commitment to make the best meal and its dedication to employee welfare. 
    message6     : As we serve our corporate, industrial, institutional, and health care clients throughout Gujarat, our passion, expertise & commitment to consistent quality and standards remains at the very heart of everything we do.
    message7     : We look forward to being at your service in the very near future.
